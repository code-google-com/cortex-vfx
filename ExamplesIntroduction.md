# Examples #

Cortex offers a huge array of features for VFX and Animation production. The code is constantly being improved, but due to time constraints it is currently not possible to create fully fledged end-user documentation.

Instead these pages aim to give you a small glimpse of the functionality, introduce you to some of the main concepts and provide examples for common use cases you might encounter in production. Most of these examples are written in Python, using the thinly bound C++ Cortex Api. There are very simple examples as well as more involved setups, just have a look around!

If this has wet your appetite - the best place to learn more about the components of Cortex are its many [test-cases](http://code.google.com/p/cortex-vfx/source/browse/#svn/trunk/test) (which often are easily readable) as well as the [doxygen code documentation](http://opensource.image-engine.com/doc/cortex-5.6.0/).

If you are curious about certain aspects of Cortex not covered here, or just want further information, please don't hesitate to post an email to the [developer discussion list](http://groups.google.com/group/cortexdev).

And if you come up with your own little examples demonstrating a feature of cortex - we'd love to have a look and add it to theses pages!
