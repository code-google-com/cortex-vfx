Cortex 6.0.0
============

Features :

* New Nuke plugin provides hosting of procedurals and ops within Nuke.

Improvements :

* DisplayDriver factory mechanism has been improved, and support for mapping RenderMan displays to IECore::DisplayDrivers has been added to IECoreRI. Images can now be rendered direct to memory using 3delight with no intermediate rib or image files. See test/IECoreRI/DspyTest.py for examples.

* AttributeCache now performs validation of names for headers, objects and attributes.

* IECoreMaya::ToMayaImageConverter and IECoreMaya::FromMayaImageConverter now have python bindings. See test/IECoreMaya/ImageConverterTest.py for examples.

Changes :

* Removed deprecated methods from InterpolatedCache - all queries now specify a frame, allowing efficient sharing of one cache among multiple threads.

* Removed deprecated methods classParameterModificationContext, setClassParameterClass and setClassVectorParameterClasses from IECoreMaya.FnParameterisedHolder. The parameterModificationContext method should be used instead.

Bug fixes :

* Fixed crashes caused by using SxRenderer with texture lookup shaders in multiple threads.
