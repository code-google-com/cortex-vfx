This example shows you how to quickly create a *Cortex Procedural SOP* using a python function and associate it with a Cortex Procedural. You must have your procedurals installed as detailed in [TODO]. 

= Usage  =
{{{
IECoreHoudini.FnProceduralHolder.create(obj_name, procedural_type, procedural_version)
}}}
  * The first arg is the *string* name of the Houdini geometry OBJ that contains the ieProceduralHolder SOP. 
  * The second args is the *string* name of the procedural to load. 
  * The third arg is the *integer* version of the procedural to load.

= Code  =
{{{
 import IECoreHoudini
 IECoreHoudini.FnProceduralHolder.create( "myObjectName", "myProcedural", 1 )
}}}
