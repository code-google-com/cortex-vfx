#summary Build instructions

= Overview =

Internal Image Engine builds of IECore are made using a customised build system unsuitable for external use. This page describes how IECore can be built outside Image Engine. The external build process has yet to stabilise, so if you encounter problems please raise them on the [http://groups.google.com/group/cortexdev cortex developers list].

= Prerequisites =
 
IECore is built using the SCons built tool, which is not installed as standard on many systems. It should be downloaded and installed from http://www.scons.org. You will need at least version 0.97.

You will also need the [http://www.openexr.org OpenEXR] and [http://www.boost.org boost] libraries. Internally at Image Engine we currently use OpenEXR 1.4.0 and boost 1.33.1, but builds with the latest versions (1.6.0 and 1.34.1 respectively) are known to work.

Finally, you'll need at least Python version 2.4. This is preinstalled on many systems, but current Apple systems ship with only version 2.3, so you may need to download and install a later version from http://www.python.org/download.

= Optional Prerequisites =

If you don't already have them, you may wish to download and install the [http://www.ijg.org/ JPEG] and [http://www.libtiff.org/ TIFF] libraries, to add further image format support.

To generate the documentation you'll also need a recent version of [http://www.doxygen.org Doxygen].

= Building =
 
Currently there are no packages for download, so you'll need to check out the source code from [http://code.google.com/p/cortex-vfx/source subversion].

Assuming vanilla installs of all the dependencies in the default locations, you should simply be able to issue the following command to build the library and python module : 
 
 *scons*
 
 If your libraries are installed in nonstandard locations you may need to add a few command line options to specify those locations. A list of available options with help is obtained with the following command :

*scons --help*
