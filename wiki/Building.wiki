# Instructions for building IECore

= Overview =

Internal Image Engine builds of IECore are made using a customised build system unsuitable for external use. This page describes how IECore can be built outside Image Engine. The external build process has yet to stabilise, so if you encounter problems please raise them on the [http://groups.google.com/group/cortexdev cortex developers list].

= Prerequisites =
 
IECore is built using the SCons built tool, which is not installed as standard on many systems. It should be downloaded and installed from http://www.scons.org. You will need at least version 0.97.

You will also need the [http://www.openexr.org OpenEXR] and [http://www.boost.org boost] libraries. Internally at Image Engine we currently use OpenEXR 1.4.0 and boost 1.33.1, but builds with the latest versions (1.6.0 and 1.34.1 respectively) are known to work.

Finally, you'll need at least Python version 2.4. This is preinstalled on many systems, but current Apple systems ship with only version 2.3, so you may need to download and install a later version from http://www.python.org/download.

= Optional Prerequisites =

You may also wish to install libtiff and libjpeg.......
