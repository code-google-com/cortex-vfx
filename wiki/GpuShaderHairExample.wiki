#summary An example procedural showing a simple hair system with GPU based Marschner shading.

= Introduction =


An example of a simple hair system inside a procedural, complete with Marschner based hair shading. Sadly no shadows yet.

It demonstrates a couple of concepts:

 * Parameter checksumming to improve interactive performance.
 * Use of glsl shaders with textures.
 * Use of IECore point distribution functions to seed hairs.

and set *$CORTEX_POINTDISTRIBUTION_TILESET* accordingly, if you haven't already one so.
