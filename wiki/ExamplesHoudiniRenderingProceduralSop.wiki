= Rendering Cortex Procedural from Houdini =
Rendering a Cortex procedural from Houdini in !RenderMan requires attaching a special Geometry Shader which injects the procedural and it's parameters into the RIB. 

[http://cortex-vfx.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/Cookbook_usingCortexRender.jpg]

The geometry shader is then assigned to the top-level object in Houdini and at render-time will evaluate the procedural and inject it's parameters into the RIB. It is really just a thin layer built on top of the `ri_dynamicload SHOP` that comes with Houdini.
