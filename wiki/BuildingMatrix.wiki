#summary Build Matrix for Cortex 5

= Introduction =

There is no standard library configuration that software developers are using. So different kind of standard software like Maya or Houdini might need a different library configuration. In a studio environment you might want to work with Cortex across multiple software platforms and hence you will have to build a specific Cortex configuration that works with the intended 3rd party software.
The below build matrix shows a number of configuration that are successfully being used in a Linux environment and Cortex 5.

Notes:
 * Maya and Houdini use different TBB  versions than 2.2, but all claim compatibility - so far no adverse affects have been noticed using Cortex linked against TBB 2.2 with and Maya or Houdini Version
 * Houdini12.0 uses OpenEXR 1.7.1 and we have only tested with 1.6.1. There is a known issue that using the EXRImageReader will crash Houdini in this scenario. If you're able to match OpenEXR versions with Houdini, that would be preferable.
 * Cortex 7 only works with Houdini 12.0 and higher. It is incompatible with Houdini 11 and previous
 * Arnold requires Boost 1.43
