#summary Build Matrix for Cortex 5

= Introduction =

There is no standard library configuration that software developers are using. So different kind of standard software like Maya or Houdini might need a different library configuration. In a studio environment you might want to work with Cortex across multiple software platforms and hence you will have to build a specific Cortex configuration that works with the intended 3rd party software.
The below build matrix shows a number of configuration that are successfully being used in a Linux environment and Cortex 5.

Notes:
 * Maya2009-sp1 uses TBB 2.1, however Cortex uses multiple TBB 2.2 features - so far no adverse affects have been noticed using Cortex linked against TBB 2.2 with Maya2009-sp1
